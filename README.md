## What is OSINT?
OSINT stands for open source intelligence. Meaning that all information is free to the public online. Anyone can view it. This makes it great for backround checks on people, prject research, locating images, and more. The concept is fairly easy to understand, but it does get a lot more in depth.

## Google Dorking with SOCMINT
During SOCIMT, it's important to use the whole internet to your advantage. This includes search engines, but i'll be only covering Google for this.
A more indepth guide for google dorking will be defined later in the guide, but these are useful from gathered SOCMINT information.
Along with the listings of google dorks, is possible information you can find off of them.

- **"(NEIGHBORHOOD) (FULL NAME)"** : participated clubs, sports, businesses, relatives, school, photos.
- **"(SCHOOL DISTRICT) (FULL NAME)"** : grade, age, confirmed school, clubs, sports, friends, yearbook photos.
- **"(NEIGHBORHOOD) (CONFIRMED SPORT)"** : photos, possible friends, age, roster, possible school information.

## Gather Intel From Associates
Sometimes, friends and family may be the key to finding out information on a person. 
If your target has no apparent location or school listed on lets say Instagram for example, using his followers, following, and comments are the key to finding that out.
Check the comments on and tagged users in post, it should be pretty easy to tell who his friends are. All it takes is some searching around to see a location or school, and if you arn't finding what your looking for, check another possible friend. Since you can safley assume they're friends, you may be able to compare one and one together. If you arn't sure, check on some other users. If several of them seem to live in the same neighborhood, you can have a good guess your target does too. It may take longer, but checking followers, and following may work as well. Keep note that the user will follow more IRL individuals, then randoms, so check the people he's following first.
